### Hi there, I'm Ali ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from Flatiron Schoolâ€™s full-stack software engineering program which focused on JavaScript ES6/React/Redux/Ruby on Rails, but for the past 10 years Iâ€™ve worked in various creative roles including fashion magazines, photo shoots, special events for clients like Showtime and Wu-Tang Clan, holistic wellness and product development for Le Labo. I have a BA in Anthropology from NYU where I focused on world cultures and primatology. Iâ€™ve also volunteered with wildlife in Thailand and taught English to children in impoverished areas of Cambodia.

Iâ€™ve worn many hats over the years, and this â€˜jack of all tradesâ€™ mentality has ensured that Iâ€™m adaptable, a fast learner, able to communicate effectively with all personality types and always ready to roll up my sleeves and do what it takes to get the job done. A common thread exists among all of my past roles: taking a creative idea from concept to visual and/or tangible fruition. My transition into web development is a continuation of this thread, combining my experience and love for design with the ability to bring that concept to life through code. Empathy is at the core of my beliefs, so with that I also bring detailed attention to the user experience and the innate desire to bring joy to others. I believe that tech holds this incredible power to add value and impact the world; when mixed with creativity and innovation it holds the potential to create literal magic. 

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening my skills, making connections in this incredible dev community and studying up on data structures/algorithms for tech interviews. I've also been doing some tech blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alison.quaglia), and feel pretty proud that all of my articles have been picked up by multiple publications and selected by curators for distribution in topics such as JavaScript, Programming, Visual Design and Design.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring all things front end. I'm passionate about UX, design and all things visual and/or interactive. I'd love to learn more about AR/VR and animation someday.

ðŸ’¬  Ask me about travel, vegan cooking, natural skincare, animals/wildlife conservation, the fashion industry, UX/UI Design, all things Disney, or random/interesting stories from my past. I have many.
